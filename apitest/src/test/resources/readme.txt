Put in this folder the SoapUI project files. Be sure each one has at least one TestCase.
Their filename must be ended with "soapui-project.xml", in order to take place on the
test execution. If the project is a SoapUI 5 project, the tag con:authType value must be
replaced by "Global HTTP Settings".
